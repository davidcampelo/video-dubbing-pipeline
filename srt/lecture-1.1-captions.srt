Hi, welcome to the short training 1.1

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,500
this video presents the Safety Assurance Information Model

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,980
we will start by reviewing some general concepts, then we present the information model,

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,020
and finally we present an illustrative example of the use of the model

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,720
the first concept is "Safety", which refers to the absence

6
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:39,300
of unacceptable risks in the design and implementation of a critical system

7
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:47,520
"Safety assurance" refers to the systematic and planned actions, activities and processes

8
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,560
that are necessary to provide adequate confidence that the product,

9
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,720
service or system under development has achieved an acceptable level of safety

10
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,580
"Information model" refers to a representation of concepts and

11
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,620
relationships, constraints, rules and operations that specify the semantics

12
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:15,600
for a given set of data within an application domain

13
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:25,500
What is the Safety Assurance Information Model (SAIM)? The purpose of this information model

14
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,200
is to represent critical system project development information

15
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,620
The model focuses on information that is relevant to

16
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:41,880
quality assessment and safety assurance activities, especially

17
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:48,540
Assurance Case development activities. The SAIM model combines three perspectives:

18
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,900
i) The model requirements traceability reference model by Ramesh & Jarke

19
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:00,660
ii) the requirements metamodel focused on security requirements by Vilela

20
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:07,020
and iii) the Assurance Cases specification model based on GSN notation

21
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,800
We provide links to these works in the video description

22
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,800
This is the SAIM metamodel

23
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,640
the main concept is "Object". which refer to any type of input or output

24
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,640
of the system development process at the level of granularity that the team

25
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,960
decided to manage them. "Sources" are any type of

26
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,480
external artifact that is linked to "Objects" but which are not managed within the tools

27
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,800
the "documents" relationship can link a "Source" to an "Object" that it documents

28
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,000
the other types of elements that appear in the

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,560
SAIM model are recurring concepts in the modeling of safety requirements

30
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:14,040
"Requirements" represent the expected conditions or capabilities that the system must satisfy

31
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:22,140
"Hazards" represent system states that can lead to accidents or cause harm

32
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:32,400
"Safety Requirements" is a subtype of "Requirement" that is related to safety aspects

33
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,900
the "mitigates" relationship links the "Safety Requirement" to the "Hazards"

34
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,680
they address

35
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,880
"Definition Design" is a design decision that

36
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,080
specifies or constrains parts of the system or some component

37
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:03,000
the "realizes" relationship links a "Design Definition" to the "Requirements" it realizes

38
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,280
"Components" are units of architecture, modules or system code at any

39
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,700
level the team has decided to track. There are two relationships linked to "Components"

40
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,800
the "allocates" relationship links a "Component" to the "Requirements" that are assigned to it

41
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,960
and the "implements" relationship links a

42
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,220
"Component" to "Design Definitions" that are implemented by it

43
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:40,140
"Causes" is any "Object" that produces some kind of "Hazard" as its effect

44
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:45,840
e.g., a new "Requirement" or "Design Definition" may cause a

45
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,720
"Hazard" so it should be mapped also as a "Cause"

46
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,420
the "causes" relationship links any "Object" to "Hazards" that are caused by it

47
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:04,200
"Contexts" are environmental or operational conditions that are relevant to safety

48
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,220
"Objects" that contextualizes others are represented

49
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,020
by the "contextualizes" relationship

50
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:19,740
"Rationale" is an explanation that provides

51
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,780
additional information for some "Object". One of the types is "Justification", that is

52
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:29,760
an explanation about a decision related to requirements, design or hazards

53
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,980
"Assumption" is an explanation that assumes a common

54
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,740
domain situation held true by stakeholders

55
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:44,340
"Strategy" is an explanation of mitigation approaches or related argumentation

56
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:51,960
"Rationales" can be linked to other "Objects" through the "explains" relationship

57
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:58,860
the SAIM model also includes attributes for the "Objects"

58
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,800
these attributes represent data information

59
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,880
commonly stored in management tools

60
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:12,540
and are helpful to leverage the analysis of project data 

61
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,720
automatically extracted from project management tools

62
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:24,000
we will now present an illustrative example of how the SAIM model can be used to

63
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,160
represent data from a critical system project. the example is related to the design of a

64
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,380
patient-controlled analgesic infusion pump used within a clinical setting

65
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,200
we will discuss the part of the design related to the notification of caregivers

66
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:48,180
that is triggered in the event of detecting of imminent battery exhaustion

67
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:58,380
the diagram in the figure shows the model based in SAIM, which will be discussed step by step now

68
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:06,180
Hazard of battery exhaustion is part of a group of hazards related to under-infusion

69
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:13,740
it occurs when the patient receives less analgesic doses than prescribed

70
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:19,260
in the example, the hazard of under-infusion is represented as the object "H1"

71
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:29,280
the hazard of battery exhaustion is represented as object "H2" that refines the hazard "H1"

72
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,960
In order to mitigate the hazard "H2",

73
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,940
the safety requirement "R1" concerning notification function for caregivers has been defined,

74
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:52,320
assumption "A1" presents a rationale for requirement "R1", the assumption

75
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,120
provides an explanation regarding the advance required in triggering the notification

76
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:05,520
requirement "R1" is allocated in component "Comp3" concerning the notification module

77
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,480
all these information items can be modeled using the SAIM

78
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:19,260
Continuing, requirement "R1" is refined into a low-level requirement called "R4"

79
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:25,920
requirement "R4" details how the exhaustion notification will work by specifying

80
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:32,760
the criteria for triggering the notification. Finally requirement "R4" has evidence

81
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:39,720
associated with its implementation and testing. In this case, they are external artifacts mapped as "Sources"

82
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:46,800
we concluded the quick training. the objective was to show how

83
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,200
safety information can be managed together with other project information

84
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:58,080
the SAIM model serves as a guide for the organization of project information

85
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,840
the model was planned to be lean and be extended according to the particularities of each project

86
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,060
Thank you for your attention
