Hello, welcome this is short training 1.3

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,260
this video introduces basics about

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:17,220
safety assurance cases using GSN notation

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,020
let's introduce some general concepts about assurance cases,

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,780
introduce the GSN notation, and show an example of a safety assurance case

6
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,940
an Assurance Cas represents a reasoned and compelling argument

7
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,780
that a service. system or organization will operate

8
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,860
as intended for a given application in a given environment

9
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,140
in other words, the assurance case makes a solid argument based on evidence

10
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,880
that the system operates and complies with requirements specifications

11
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,300
safety assurance cases, in particular, focus on demonstrating

12
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,400
that a given system is acceptably safe to operate in a given context

13
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,600
arguments are structured as a series of claims,

14
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,980
that state an overall claim

15
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,620
e.g. in the design of a critical system, the main claim is that the system

16
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,540
is acceptably safe to operate

17
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,460
the claims are refined into supporting claims,

18
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:36,660
and these supporting claims provide rationales to explain requirements and design decisions

19
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:42,000
examples of claims are requirements, hazards, design definitions,

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,840
i.e., any aspect of the system design that needs to be adequately satisfied or mitigated

21
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,120
at some point in the argumentation, the claims are not further refined,

22
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,000
and are then linked to pieces of evidence that support the claims

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,480
the set of evidence is formed by artifacts produced throughout the development process

24
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,760
the GSN (Goal Structuring Notation) is a

25
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,320
visual notation for building the arguments of assurance cases

26
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,900
by using GSN, it is possible to explicitly document the entire hierarchy of

27
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,400
claims and evidence that structure the argument in favor of a system

28
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,140
the notation provides a semantics for constructing arguments,

29
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:42,120
claims are called "Goals", supporting arguments can be "Strategies",

30
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,980
"Assumption" or "Justifications", and items of evidence are

31
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,800
ultimately "Solutions", contextual information is mapped to elements of type "Context"

32
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,940
the GSN main elements follow the visual notation depicted on the left

33
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,960
in the figure on the right, there is a partial example of a assurance case

34
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:10,080
"Goals" represent something to be achieved, for example a requirement

35
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,820
to be satisfactorily implemented, or a hazard to be adequately mitigated

36
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,140
the "Goals" comprise the central structure of the argumentation

37
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,420
"Strategies" represent explanations that clarify

38
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,260
how the high-level goal connects to supporting goals

39
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,900
for example in the figure, the strategy for dealing with hazard analysis is

40
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,440
to argue separately about product and process aspects

41
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,900
throughout the argumentation, it may be necessary to contextualize information,

42
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,720
the "Context" element is used to represent this

43
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:53,880
in the example in the figure, a requirements specification is used as "Context"

44
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:03,840
finally, in the bottom of the argument it is expected to have items of evidence, called "Solutions",

45
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,740
these solutions point to artifacts generated during the development of the system,

46
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:19,260
if an Goal is not refined into other Goals or linked to Solutions, we say that the

47
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:25,620
Goal is undeveloped, which is expected in the early phases of the project life cycle,

48
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:31,380
the GSN notation also defines two types of elements to

49
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:36,900
represent rationales: the "Justifications" and the "Assumptions"

50
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,180
the links allowed between GSN elements

51
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,100
are the link "Supported By" and the link "In Context Of"

52
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:53,760
in the previous slide, it is demonstrated the use of the "supported by" link that interconnects goals,

53
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,840
whereas the "in context of" link serves to associate

54
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:08,760
the main arguments to contextual or rationale information such as justifications and assumptions

55
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,260
let's present an example of a assurance case specified in GSN, which is based

56
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:21,360
in the same design model from the illustrative example of training 1.1

57
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,480
the design refers to a patient-controlled analgesic infusion pump, the part

58
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:32,580
of the design that we deal with in this example involves mitigating the hazard of battery exhaustion

59
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,980
the figure shows the modeling based on the SAIM model (Safety Assurance Information

60
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,370
Model) that we discussed in the previous training 1.1

61
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:50,100
Let's show how this information can be organized into an argument using GSN

62
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:56,280
the arguments are built based on the design information, in this part of the argument

63
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,940
the focus is on the hazard of battery exhaustion

64
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:06,660
the mitigation of this hazard is mapped as a high-level goal in the argument

65
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:13,560
note: throughout this example, we are highlighting the SAIM model excerpt on the left

66
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:20,100
and on the right how the element is mapped into the GSN argument

67
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:30,120
the argument then starts with a high-level hazard that was selected: battery exhaustion

68
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:37,020
in order to contextualize the hazard category to which this "battery exhaustion" belongs,

69
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:42,420
we mapped the high-level under-infusion hazard as a "Context" element

70
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,240
Continuing in the argument development,

71
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,940
the requirement "caregiver notification" mitigates the hazard of battery drain,

72
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,000
so the requirement is mapped as a Goal

73
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,020
and a "supported by" link is created between hazard and requirement

74
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:07,740
in turn, the assumption "Sufficient time", that provides an explanation for the

75
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:15,480
notification requirement, is mapped as a assumption and connected through the link "In Context Of"

76
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:23,400
the allocation of the requirement is also an important contextual information,

77
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,780
so the notification module is mapped as a "Context" element

78
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:37,020
advancing in the decomposition of the system, there is an "exhaustion notification" requirement that refines the

79
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:42,840
"caregiver notification" requirement. It is mapped as a "Goal" and linked by a "Supported By" 

80
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:53,640
finally, the two sources that document the "exhaustion notification" requirement are

81
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:59,100
mapped as "Solutions", thus representing supporting evidence to the argument

82
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:04,260
it is important to emphasize that this is one of the valid alternatives for mapping

83
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:08,760
the design of this project to an argument in GSN, but it is not the only one

84
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,540
the mitigation of the hazard can be argued from

85
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:16,380
other perspectives, since there are a variety of argumentation patterns

86
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:22,860
what it is important to grasp is that, whatever the pattern of argumentation,

87
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:28,860
the information used is the same and originates in the project development artifacts

88
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:35,220
we completed this short training aimed to leverage some concepts about assurance cases

89
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:39,900
they are built based on project information, also requiring

90
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:44,820
information on rationales and safety assurance

91
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,940
there is no direct mapping of

92
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,740
project data to GSN elements, as the same project items can be mapped

93
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:58,800
differently depending on the argumentation pattern adopted

94
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,660
Thank you for your attention
