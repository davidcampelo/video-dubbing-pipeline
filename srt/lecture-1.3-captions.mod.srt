Hello, welcome to the short training 1.3!

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:17,220
this video introduces the basics about safety assurance cases using the GSN notation.

3
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:27,780
let's introduce some general concepts about assurance cases, introduce the GSN notation, and show an example of a safety assurance case.

4
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:43,860
An assurance case represents a reasoned and compelling argument that a service, system or organization will operate as intended for a given application in a given environment

5
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:53,880
In other words, the assurance case makes a solid argument based on evidence that the system operates and complies with requirements specifications.

6
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:05,400
safety assurance cases, in particular, focus on demonstrating that a given system is acceptably safe to operate in a given context.

7
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:16,980
arguments are structured as a series of claims that state an overall claim.

8
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:24,540
for example, in the design of a critical system the main claim is that the system is acceptably safe to operate.

9
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:36,660
the claims are refined into supporting claims, and these supporting claims provide rationales to explain requirements and design decisions.

10
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:48,840
examples of claims are requirements, hazards, design definitions or any aspect of the system design that needs to be adequately satisfied or mitigated.

11
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:57,000
at some point in the argumentation, claims are not further refined and are linked to pieces of evidence that support them.

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,480
the set of evidence is formed by artifacts produced throughout the development process

13
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:19,320
The Goal Structuring Notation (G.S.N.) is a visual notation for building the arguments of assurance cases.

14
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:29,400
By using GSN, it is possible to explicitly document the entire hierarchy of claims and evidence that structure the argument in favor of a system.

15
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,140
the notation provides a semantics for constructing arguments.

16
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:52,800
Claims are called "Goals", supporting arguments can be "Strategies", "Assumption" or "Justifications", and items of evidence are ultimately "Solutions", contextual information is mapped to elements of type "Context".

17
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,940
the G.S.N. main elements follow the visual notation depicted on the left.

18
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,960
in the figure on the right, there is a partial example of an assurance case.

19
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:14,820
"Goals" represent something to be achieved, for example a requirement to be implemented, or a hazard to be adequately mitigated

20
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,140
the "Goals" comprise the central structure of the argumentation.

21
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:28,260
"Strategies" represent explanations that clarify how the high-level goal connects to supporting goals.

22
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:37,440
for example in the figure, the strategy for dealing with hazard analysis is to argue separately about product and process aspects.

23
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:45,720
throughout the argumentation, it may be necessary to contextualize information, the "Context" element is used to represent this.

24
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:53,880
in the example of the image, a requirements specification is used as "Context".

25
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:03,840
finally, in the bottom of the argument it is expected to have items of evidence, called "Solutions".

26
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,740
these solutions point to artifacts generated during the development of the system.

27
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:25,620
if an Goal is not refined into other Goals or linked to Solutions, we say that the Goal is undeveloped, which is expected in the early phases of the project life cycle.

28
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:36,900
the GSN notation also defines two types of elements to represent rationales: the "Justifications" and the "Assumptions". 

29
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:47,100
the links allowed between GSN elements are the link "Supported By" and the link "In Context Of".

30
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:53,760
in the previous slide, it is demonstrated the use of the "supported by" link that interconnects goals.

31
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:08,760
The "in context of" link serves to associate the main arguments to contextual or rationale information such as justifications and assumptions.

32
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:21,360
let's present an example of a assurance case specified in GSN, which is based in the same design model from the illustrative example of training 1.1.

33
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:32,580
the design refers to a patient-controlled analgesic infusion pump, the part of the design that we deal with in this example involves mitigating the hazard of battery exhaustion.

34
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:44,370
the figure shows the modeling based on the Safety Assurance Information Model presented on training 1.1.

35
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:50,100
Let's show how this information can be organized into an argument using GSN.

36
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:59,940
the arguments are built based on the design information, in this part of the argument the focus is on the hazard of battery exhaustion.

37
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:06,660
the mitigation of this hazard is mapped as a high-level goal in the argument.

38
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:20,100
Throughout this example, we are highlighting the referred part of the model on the left and on the right how the element is mapped into the GSN argument.

39
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:30,120
the argument then starts with a high-level hazard that was selected: battery exhaustion.

40
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:42,420
in order to contextualize the hazard category to which this "battery exhaustion" belongs, we mapped the high-level under-infusion hazard as a "Context" element.

41
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:50,940
Continuing in the argument development, the requirement "caregiver notification" mitigates the hazard of battery drain.

42
00:06:50,940 --> 00:07:01,020
Hence, the requirement is mapped as a Goal and a "supported by" link is created between hazard and requirement.

43
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:15,480
in turn, the assumption "Sufficient time", that provides an explanation for the notification requirement, is mapped as an Assumption and connected through the link "In Context Of".

44
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:23,400
the allocation of the requirement is also an important contextual information.

45
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,780
so the notification module is mapped as a "Context" element.

46
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:42,840
there is also an "exhaustion notification" requirement that refines the "caregiver notification" requirement, which is mapped as a "Goal" and linked by a "Supported By".

47
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:59,100
and finally, the two sources that document the "exhaustion notification" requirement are mapped as "Solutions", thus representing supporting evidence to the argument.

48
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:08,760
it is important to emphasize that this is one of the valid alternatives for mapping the design of this project to an argument in GSN, but it is not the only one.

49
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:16,380
the mitigation of the hazard can be argued from other perspectives, since there are a variety of argumentation patterns.

50
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:28,860
All in all, whatever the pattern of argumentation is, the information used is the same and is originated in the project development artifacts.

51
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:35,220
we completed this short training aimed to leverage some concepts about assurance cases.

52
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:44,820
they are built based on project information, also requiring information on rationales and safety assurance.

53
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:58,800
there is no direct mapping of project data to GSN elements, as the same project items can be mapped differently depending on the argumentation pattern adopted.

54
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,660
Thanks for your attention and participation!
