Hello, welcome this is short training 1.3

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:17,220
this video introduces basics about safety assurance cases using GSN notation.

3
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:27,780
let's introduce some general concepts about assurance cases, introduce the GSN notation, and show an example of a safety assurance case.

4
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:43,860
an Assurance Case represents a reasoned and compelling argument that a service, system or organization will operate as intended for a given application in a given environment

5
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:53,880
In other words, the assurance case makes a solid argument based on evidence that the system operates and complies with requirements specifications.

6
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:05,400
safety assurance cases, in particular, focus on demonstrating that a given system is acceptably safe to operate in a given context.

7
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:16,980
arguments are structured as a series of claims, that state an overall claim.

8
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:24,540
for example, in the design of a critical system, the main claim is that the system is acceptably safe to operate.

9
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:36,660
the claims are refined into supporting claims, and these supporting claims provide rationales to explain requirements and design decisions.

10
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:48,840
examples of claims are requirements, hazards, design definitions, or any aspect of the system design that needs to be adequately satisfied or mitigated.

11
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:57,000
at some point in the argumentation, claims are not further refined and are linked to pieces of evidence that support them.

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,480
the set of evidence is formed by artifacts produced throughout the development process

13
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:19,320
The Goal Structuring Notation (G.S.N.) is a visual notation for building the arguments of assurance cases.

14
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:29,400
By using GSN, it is possible to explicitly document the entire hierarchy of claims and evidence that structure the argument in favor of a system.

15
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,140
the notation provides a semantics for constructing arguments.

16
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:52,800
Claims are called "Goals", supporting arguments can be "Strategies", "Assumption" or "Justifications", and items of evidence are ultimately "Solutions", contextual information is mapped to elements of type "Context".

17
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,940
the G.S.N. main elements follow the visual notation depicted on the left.

18
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,960
in the figure on the right, there is a partial example of an assurance case.

19
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:14,820
"Goals" represent something to be achieved, for example a requirement to be implemented, or a hazard to be adequately mitigated

20
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,140
the "Goals" comprise the central structure of the argumentation.

21
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:28,260
"Strategies" represent explanations that clarify how the high-level goal connects to supporting goals.

22
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:37,440
for example in the figure, the strategy for dealing with hazard analysis is to argue separately about product and process aspects.

23
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:45,720
throughout the argumentation, it may be necessary to contextualize information, the "Context" element is used to represent this.

24
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:53,880
in the example in the figure, a requirements specification is used as "Context"

25
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:03,840
finally, in the bottom of the argument it is expected to have items of evidence, called "Solutions",

26
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,740
these solutions point to artifacts generated during the development of the system,

27
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:19,260
if an Goal is not refined into other Goals or linked to Solutions, we say that the

28
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:25,620
Goal is undeveloped, which is expected in the early phases of the project life cycle,

29
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:31,380
the GSN notation also defines two types of elements to

30
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:36,900
represent rationales: the "Justifications" and the "Assumptions"

31
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,180
the links allowed between GSN elements

32
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,100
are the link "Supported By" and the link "In Context Of"

33
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:53,760
in the previous slide, it is demonstrated the use of the "supported by" link that interconnects goals,

34
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,840
whereas the "in context of" link serves to associate

35
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:08,760
the main arguments to contextual or rationale information such as justifications and assumptions

36
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,260
let's present an example of a assurance case specified in GSN, which is based

37
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:21,360
in the same design model from the illustrative example of training 1.1

38
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,480
the design refers to a patient-controlled analgesic infusion pump, the part

39
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:32,580
of the design that we deal with in this example involves mitigating the hazard of battery exhaustion

40
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,980
the figure shows the modeling based on the SAIM model (Safety Assurance Information

41
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,370
Model) that we discussed in the previous training 1.1

42
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:50,100
Let's show how this information can be organized into an argument using GSN

43
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:56,280
the arguments are built based on the design information, in this part of the argument

44
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,940
the focus is on the hazard of battery exhaustion

45
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:06,660
the mitigation of this hazard is mapped as a high-level goal in the argument

46
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:13,560
note: throughout this example, we are highlighting the SAIM model excerpt on the left

47
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:20,100
and on the right how the element is mapped into the GSN argument

48
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:30,120
the argument then starts with a high-level hazard that was selected: battery exhaustion

49
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:37,020
in order to contextualize the hazard category to which this "battery exhaustion" belongs,

50
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:42,420
we mapped the high-level under-infusion hazard as a "Context" element

51
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,240
Continuing in the argument development,

52
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,940
the requirement "caregiver notification" mitigates the hazard of battery drain,

53
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,000
so the requirement is mapped as a Goal

54
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,020
and a "supported by" link is created between hazard and requirement

55
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:07,740
in turn, the assumption "Sufficient time", that provides an explanation for the

56
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:15,480
notification requirement, is mapped as a assumption and connected through the link "In Context Of"

57
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:23,400
the allocation of the requirement is also an important contextual information,

58
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,780
so the notification module is mapped as a "Context" element

59
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:37,020
advancing in the decomposition of the system, there is an "exhaustion notification" requirement that refines the

60
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:42,840
"caregiver notification" requirement. It is mapped as a "Goal" and linked by a "Supported By" 

61
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:53,640
finally, the two sources that document the "exhaustion notification" requirement are

62
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:59,100
mapped as "Solutions", thus representing supporting evidence to the argument

63
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:04,260
it is important to emphasize that this is one of the valid alternatives for mapping

64
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:08,760
the design of this project to an argument in GSN, but it is not the only one

65
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,540
the mitigation of the hazard can be argued from

66
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:16,380
other perspectives, since there are a variety of argumentation patterns

67
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:22,860
what it is important to grasp is that, whatever the pattern of argumentation,

68
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:28,860
the information used is the same and originates in the project development artifacts

69
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:35,220
we completed this short training aimed to leverage some concepts about assurance cases

70
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:39,900
they are built based on project information, also requiring

71
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:44,820
information on rationales and safety assurance

72
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,940
there is no direct mapping of

73
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,740
project data to GSN elements, as the same project items can be mapped

74
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:58,800
differently depending on the argumentation pattern adopted

75
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,660
Thank you for your attention
